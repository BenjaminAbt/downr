# Welcome !

downr is a **very** simple blogging engine written for people who like using [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) to write content and Git to maintain their source code and/or content files.

* Enable bloggers with Markdown syntax-driven blogging
* Create an enjoyable experience for developer bloggers using [Visual Studio Code](http://code.visualstudio.com) or the [Visual Studio Markdown Editor](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MadsKristensen.MarkdownEditor) extension to author their content and maintain their site
* Support Git deployment to Azure App Service*
* Separate the responsibilities of maintaining presentation and content from the source code of the site

downr is written using [.NET Core](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core), and is packaged and deployed using [NPM](http://npmjs.com), [Bower](http://bower.io), and [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com). It is open-source and available on GitHub at [http://github.com/bradygaster/downr](http://github.com/bradygaster/downr). 

\* *Azure isn't a deployment target requirement. So long as your desired cloud provider supports NPM, Grunt, and ASP.NET Core, you're cool.*
