Scoble,
<a>this is a ridiculous comparison</a> . Of course you forget to mention the fact that in 1998 XMLHTTP was only useful for IE. Nothing else. Not until recently has support been introduced for TRUE cross-platform XMLHTTP-esque functionality. That - not the
pretty name - is the reason for the newfound interest and widespread adoption. Once everyone can play with the toy, the toy becomes a lot more fun for everyone.
