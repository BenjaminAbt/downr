<p>MADExpo 2011 was great. I met some new people, had some engaging conversations, saw some amazing presentions, and overall was humbled by the level of expertise in the room. I&apos;ll summarize my thoughts on the event and my experiences in this post.&#xA0;</p>
<p>My mind was completely and totally blown by
  <a>Joshua Blake&apos;s</a>  presentation on NUI. I&apos;d never seen a Surface PC before the presentation and was even more amazed by it than I&apos;d imagined.&#xA0;</p>
<p>I got to meet
  <a>Chris Walker</a>  from
  <a>Secret Labs</a>, and we had an awesome conversation. His genuine appreciation to myself and others who have evangelized Netduino was obvious, the kind of appreciation that makes it so worthwhile to spend the time learning, tinkering, and hoping that
  NETMF&apos;s current steam engine can continue. Chris confirmed how busy he&apos;s been with the growth of NETMF and Netduino, talked about some awesome possibillities in the future for the platform, and packed up and left to drive 8 hours back to NYC where he
  had more work to do. That sort of commitment to one&apos;s craft and company is inspiring.</p>
<p>Speaking of inspiring.
  <a>Phil Japiske</a>  gave a presentation on testing legacy code that everyone who has to work in a brown-field project, ever, should see. His presentation style is something an aspiring speaker like myself can learn from and emulate (not to mention some
  gorgeous slides). We had an interesting conversation afterwards regarding corporate direction, focus, and getting spread too thin, and I feel pretty schooled afterwards. His experience and willingness is amazing.&#xA0;</p>
<p>I also really enjoyed seeing a deep dive in how to use SpecFlow and a few other tools to do some awesome BDD by
  <a>Jimmy Bosse</a> . I&apos;d just given my own BDD presentation, which contained a shallow dive into using SpecFlow, so it was awesome to sit tight and be schooled on the same thing by someone as knowledgeable as Jimmy.&#xA0;</p>
<p>Of course, not everything was perfect. My own presentations on Netduino and BDD were good, but definitely plagued by a few technical issues. I appreciate my attendee&apos;s patience and hope that, in spite of a few issues, you learned some stuff and that my
  session elevated not only your knowledge, but your interest in learning more about the topics. I&apos;ll provide links to the presentations below.&#xA0;</p>
<p>Thanks so much to the sponsors and organizers for putting on the event and giving me the opportunity to present. I enjoyed myself, learned a lot, was humbled by how much I still have to learn (thank goodness!).&#xA0;</p>
