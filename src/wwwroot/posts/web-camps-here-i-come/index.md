<p>So I&apos;m
  <a>at the airport</a>  awaiting the boarding call and wanted to take a second to update everyone. My teammte
  <a>Jon Galloway</a>  has done a great job of
  <a>talking up the upcoming web camps schedule</a> . You can find out about it more at the
  <a>Microsoft DevCamps Site specific to the web camp events</a> . This is an exciting time for the Microsoft Web Stack, and Jon, myself, and
  <a>quite a few other talented developers and speakers</a>  are going to be hitting the road to talk about all things web. If you&apos;re in Brussels on Thursday, we&apos;d love to have you there, so come register for the event online.&#xA0;</p>
<p>This is my first series of Web Camp events since joining Microsoft, and I can honestly say I&apos;m super-excited about the content we&apos;ll be distributing, presentations being put on, and about the opportunity to work with so many talented speakers and event
  coordination folks.&#xA0;</p>
<p>Learn a little more about the web camps by
  <a>watching the Channel 9 Web Camps TV Introduction</a> .&#xA0;</p>
