</a> Inspired by a
<a>Makezine </a> article I read last week covering the construction of a
<a>guitar amp stand from pvc</a>, I came up with my own design. I&apos;ve uploaded a
<a>Sketchup rendering of the amp stand</a>  so you can have some ideas on the measurements. I also created a
<a>flickr set that shows the process of construction and the finished product itself.</a>  I&apos;m pretty happy with the outcome. I ended up with an almost perfect angle - 50 degrees - to aim my amp&apos;s signal right into my face. Works almost as well as a stag
monitor, but this monitor has a spot for my effects board, a
<a>Line6 PodXT Live floor model</a>, as well.
