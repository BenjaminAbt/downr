<p>This week I had the absolute privelege of hosting the Channel 9 Web Camps TV show. The show featured
  <a>WebMatrix</a>, and our guest was
  <a>Vishal Joshi</a>, Lead Program Manager for the product. Vishal highlights some of the great new features available in the new version of WebMatrix, which you can download for free in under 2 minutes. The product is impressive and offers just about every
  single thing a web developer would need. From database edits to code completion across C#, CSS, HTML, and <strong>even PHP code completion</strong>, WebMatrix has you covered. Take a few minutes and check out the new features you can get for free on
  <a>Web Camps TV</a> .&#xA0;</p>
