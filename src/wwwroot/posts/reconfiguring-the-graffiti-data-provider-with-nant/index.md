<p>I&apos;m getting started with
  <a>Graffiti CMS</a>  right now and so far feel pretty good about all of the excellent features they&apos;ve thrown in. I prefer the SQL provider method to the default of VistaDB, so I had to go to the Graffiti support site to
  <a>find information on how convert to the SQL provider</a> . I figure if I need to do it, so will some other people. To make life easier I&apos;ve written a
  <a>NAnt script</a>  to perform this, and you&apos;ll find it
  <a>right here</a> .</p>
<p>Happy coding!</p>
